<p>Same deal as the <a href="https://pagwin.xyz/blog/speedrun/">speedrun
blog</a> putting down a bunch of ideas that I want out of my head but
aren’t worthy of a full blog.</p>
<h2 id="the-entire-set-plus-one-more-in-the-set">The entire set plus one
more in the set</h2>
<p>Let me start off where I started off<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>
lets say that someone who we shall name Steve anonymously puts a bounty
on themselves which is described as “$1 in addition to whatever money
Steve has on their person” how much money should be payed out to whoever
collects the bounty on Steve and where would it come from? Well in this
case the way that reality works and the set of actors involved
constrains us to the answer of “whatever money Steve has on their
person” and no more. This answer would correspond to addition being
equivalent to the set union operator. That does work but with slightly
different context it seems like the answer would be different, for
example pretend that a god came down and said “I am going to transfer
ten humans in addition to the entire human population to a habitable
planet in a different galaxy”. In this case specifying ten humans in
addition implies that we’re transferring a number of humans greater than
just the current human population but also ten more because otherwise
why specify those ten humans. The problem that I have is how many humans
come out on the other side. “Why not just the current population plus
ten?” well because transfer implies they already exist and aren’t being
created in that moment so the number should be the same and also my
brain thinks there’s an interpretation or slightly different wording
where you could argue there’ll be infinitely many humans. I’m pretty
sure this is a <a href="https://youtu.be/ppX7Qjbe6BM?t=2035">type 5
paradox</a></p>
<h2 id="excel-with-typesstatic-analysis">Excel with types/static
analysis?</h2>
<p>So I think I started thinking about this when I rewatched <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2zkxHDfUE">this Matt Parker
video</a>. I’m wondering if there’s a niche for some spreadsheet
software is intended to require the user to specify types for cells or a
full sql-esque table or something in addition to doing some nice
lints/static analysis like you would see in software to minimize errors.
My mind has also feature creeped this idea out a bit to have this
program capable of exporting some file package/sql database and an
executable so you can have something maintaining the structure of the
data while other programs do automated stuff in the hopes that Ludicity
doesn’t come in for a <a
href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-dropkick-you-if-you-use-that-spreadsheet/">drop
kick</a>.</p>
<h2
id="psa-please-check-to-make-sure-browser-zoom-works-okay-on-your-site-2">PSA
please check to make sure browser zoom works okay on your site <sup><a
href="#2">[2]</a></sup></h2>
<p>And also phones and screen readers but the browser zoom one is the
one that affected me when I’m writing this (over 2 months after the
prior 2 sections). Particularly if you have a blog with some text
content that’s centered with whitespace as the margins and I zoom in I
don’t just want to see the text get bigger I also want the margins to
shrink so the text has more room. Reason being so zooming isn’t
proportional to additional scrolling. Thanks.</p>
<h2
id="wait-mobile-vs-desktop-is-just-handled-via-a-css-if-statement">Wait
mobile vs desktop is just handled via a CSS if statement?</h2>
<p>I was exploring the CSS to understand how the margins shrank for my
site but not the offending site and I noticed on both sites that the css
styling jumped a bit as I shrank and grew the page width only to realize
the reason was because of some <a
href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/">CSS
if statement(s)</a>. I don’t know why I previously thought you could
deal with this in some other way but TIL.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-should-i-make-these">How long should I make these?</h2>
<p>I’ve never thought about this before but how long should I make
blogs? How long should I make microblog dumps? I don’t know I should
probably think about that… later I will think about that later.</p>
<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
<p><a href="./#1" name="1">1</a> - I started off in a fan-fic of the
stormlight archive where a character I inserted into the story was
putting up a bounty for themselves by promising “a shardblade in
addition to any shardblades or shardplate $character has on them” rather
than with money</p>
<p><a href="./#2" name="2">2</a> - If you noticed that the blog example
was specific that’s because this post was incited by a blog with
whitespace which didn’t shrink the whitespace when I zoomed. Also at
time of writing I checked to make sure my site adheres to this.</p>
