<article>
    <p>This is the second blog article I’ve written dissing on how a library
does something, the <a href="/blog/mineflayer_why">first time</a> being
effectively “Mineflayer doesn’t do things the way I want it to and that
annoys me”. This article will probably follow in that tradition but
unlike the Mineflayer one where I would’ve been inconvenienced to do
what I want with Serenity I need to make my code potentially unsound to
do what I want.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-serenity">What is Serenity?</h2>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/serenity">Serenity</a> is a rust
crate that can be used to create discord bots. I’ve used it a couple of
times without issue mainly for <a
href="https://github.com/Pagwin-Fedora/DBMS">DBMS</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/Pagwin-Fedora/discord-frame-yeet">frame
yeet</a>, very professional names I know. However the issues come up
when you want mutable state in the <a
href="https://docs.rs/serenity/0.11.5/serenity/client/trait.EventHandler.html">event
handler</a>.</p>
<h2 id="no-mutable-self">No mutable self</h2>
<p>For all the events in the event handler self is passed as a
non-mutable reference. Which means you can’t change any state in your
event handler. Serenity… why? Have you not considered the possibility
that someone may want to initialize something in their event handler
after the bot has started or to have the response to events change due
to previous events?</p>
<h2 id="yes-they-did-consider-the-possibility">Yes they did consider the
possibility</h2>
<p>It’s why they pass a <a
href="https://docs.rs/serenity/0.11.5/serenity/prelude/struct.Context.html">Context</a>
struct which has a field called data where data can be stored in a <a
href="https://docs.rs/serenity/0.11.5/serenity/prelude/struct.TypeMap.html">TypeMap</a>
which mostly solves the inability to have mutable state. Keyword
<strong>mostly</strong></p>
<h2 id="drop-the-state">Drop the state</h2>
<p>The issue is what happens if the state being stored is attached to
something else and you want the state to be dropped when that something
else is dropped. Well in that case you just have to suffer in some way
or another. You obviously need to implement the <a
href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html">Drop trait</a>
which means the struct needs to store a way to refer to the TypeMap in
itself. But Serenity doesn’t have a way to do that before you’ve
constructed the client. The <a
href="https://docs.rs/serenity/0.11.5/serenity/client/struct.ClientBuilder.html">ClientBuilder</a>
has the type_map method if you want to provide one but that moves it
which means you can’t hold onto a reference to it that can be used in
our Drop implementation. The ClientBuilder also has a get_type_map
method which gives a reference to it’s type map. But because it’s a
reference we can’t give it to the thing that wants to potentially get
rid of something in the TypeMap. Which leaves only ugly and uglier
options for dealing with this.</p>
<h2 id="ugly-solutions">Ugly solutions</h2>
<p>The first solution to this problem is to tell serenity to go fuck
itself and write unsafe code convert self to a mutable pointer which we
mutate in the ready event to initialize state within the handler with
the Arc&lt;RwLock<TypeMap>&gt; that’s provided by the Context struct.
The second solution is to give up on having Drop clean up the TypeMap at
the same time. Personally I think both of these solutions suck and wish
that I wasn’t forced to pick for the program I ran into this problem
for.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is the only Serenity specific problem I’ve run into using this
library though so I’d say it’s a good library overall. So yeah, back to
actually writing code instead of blog articles for now.</p>
