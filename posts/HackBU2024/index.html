<h1 id="hi">Hi :)</h1>
<p>Over the last weekend I went to <a
href="https://hackbu.org/2024/">HackBU 2024</a>. This blog post is me
writing about it (maybe not fully coherently). Also as an aside I went
to the 2023 hackathon as well but I didn’t write about it, oh well.</p>
<h2 id="a-reminder-that-i-can-do-things-quickly">A reminder that I can
do things quickly</h2>
<p>As with last year<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> I worked on a project
solo. Also like last year I was able to successfully get out a prototype
of that project though unlike last year the prototype didn’t completely
work. But I’m getting ahead of myself, I should probably describe what I
built before going into detail about my dissapointments in it.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-built">What I built</h2>
<p>In Binghamton there are 2 bus systems, 1 is provided by the county
and the other is provided by the university. The university buses were
not in google maps meaning google maps wouldn’t show routes involving
them. As such I was going to build a system to make it easy to get a
route using either or both bus systems.</p>
<p>This might seem ambitious at first but it was actually quite simple,
all I had to do was reverse engineer 2 live maps to get the data on bus
routes from their apis, use google’s route api to get the travel time of
the buses through their routes, calculate the best route from point A to
point B with the retrieved bus routes and learn google’s map api to
visualize the data and build a simple frontend to overlay on that for
the user to give input into…</p>
<p>I swear it sounds harder than it was.</p>
<h2 id="oops-a-bit-too-much-scope">Oops a bit too much scope</h2>
<p>Did I mention that I was planning on being even more ambitious than
what I just described by using the live bus positions and past history
to try and calculate when a bus would arrive at a particular bus stop
and that point A and point B would’ve been proper addresse if I hadn’t
cut back on scope?</p>
<p>So yeah before anything I wasted an hour or 2 working on setting up
an ORM that I didn’t use. But after that I got to work on useful
stuff.</p>
<h2 id="work-begins">Work begins</h2>
<p>First things first, I had to get the data. Now you’d think that
reverse engineering a bus live map would be hard but as it turns out
it’s pretty easy at least for what I’m doing. It was literally just</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>go to live map website</p></li>
<li><p>open up the network tab of the browser dev tools</p></li>
<li><p>refresh the page and search for the words “bus”, “route” and
“stop” in the requests</p></li>
<li><p>click on the obvious results and use brain to figure out what
json fields like “name” and “stops” and “lat” and “lon” could possibly
mean</p></li>
</ol>
<p>conveniently the Hackathon can’t really prevent prior work that isn’t
code so all of the api reverse engineering was done the day before the
hackathon so the time wasted on ORM stuff canceled out.</p>
<h2 id="why-yes-i-do-prefer-non-linear-story-telling">Why yes I do
prefer non-linear story telling</h2>
<p>That reminds me I should probably mention why I was working on this
solo as well as what I’m even using to build it. So unlike last year I
did try a little bit more to get a group to work on something with but
none of the other ideas were interesting and the people I was hoping to
group with assumed I’d be fine on my own. Which they were right but I’d
have liked the help if only so I could’ve increase the scope a bit.</p>
<p>But yeah once it was clear I’d be working on my own I decided to go
with a language I was comfortable with and that I knew had all the tools
I needed. That language being <a
href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. <a href="">Tide</a> for the
http server backend, <a href="">Reqwest</a> for making http requests to
various apis, <a href="">SerDe</a> for serializing and deserializing
json, and some other libraries which aren’t interesting to list
out<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. ## Corners cut</p>
<p>I’m not going to talk about the overall development process because
it’s boring and mostly obvious stuff. However due to being solo and only
having 24 hours I did need to cut some corners.</p>
<p>First at the start of actual work I only expected to get an api done
but no frontend, however the main bulk of the api was done before I
started really getting tired so I had plenty of time to get a frontend
with google maps out.</p>
<p>However I did have to cut many corners for finding an optimal route.
Firstly I didn’t do a graph search at all. If the optimal path used more
than 2 buses or had more than 1 bus without stopping at either the
university or the greyhound station then my system wouldn’t find it. The
reason for this was because my system only checked 3 types of route to
get from where you started to your destination. Single bus, bus to
Binghamton university then transfer to another bus and bus to the
greyhound station then transfer to another bus. This was because having
used the buses myself I know that those 3 methods will work pretty well
for getting you from point A to point B and doing a proper search seemed
like a lot of work.</p>
<p>Another corner I cut was on the heuristic for how good I considered a
route. A good heuristic would take into acount walking distance, waiting
time and bus transit time. My heuristic was to minimize euclidean
distance from the starting position to the bus stop added to the
distance between the bus stop they got off at to the destination. Which
leads to both obvious and subtle incorrectness in measuring how good
routes are but it works well enough so whatever.</p>
<p>An accidental corner I cut was that uuuh I might have forgotten/ran
out of time to put logic in to make sure we aren’t trying to go
backwards along a bus route. 90% of the time this doesn’t matter though
so eeeh.</p>
<p>The time estimate for travel is divided by 3. I don’t know why Google
Routes gave me time estimates which were higher than necessary.</p>
<p>I was going to deploy this with docker/docker-compose instead of
messing with CORS but more on that in the stories.</p>
<p>Broome county buses visually have straight lines between the bus
stops instead of following the road. I’ll talk about this a bit more
when I get into the stories but for now all you need to know is that the
reverse engineered live map doesn’t give me the path and using google
routes was something I thought I didn’t have time for until right now as
I’m writing this… Fuck.</p>
<h2 id="story-time">Story time</h2>
<h3 id="the-fucking-s">The fucking s</h3>
<p>I haven’t run into someone who’s tried to claim Google is really good
at software yet but if I do I will bring this up. So when I was using
the google routes api to figure out how long it would take I noticed
that the time format looked something like “250s”, so for about a minute
I was panicking because “oh god am I going to have to parse out time
units and standardize it” but after sending a request for a route frome
LA to NYC I got back another time with an s so it’s in seconds but
dammit if google’s documentation doesn’t say that.</p>

<h3 id="the-polyline-encoding-fuckup">The Polyline encoding fuckup</h3>
<p>Okay I didn’t say this outright before so I’ll say it now. Google’s
documentation sucks <a
href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm">here</a>’s
the page describing the polyline encoding in the off chance that’s a
dead link here’s the part that I read, assuming that the rest was
context I didn’t need</p>
<pre><code>The steps for encoding such a signed value are specified below.

    1. Take the initial signed value:
    -179.9832104
    2. Take the decimal value and multiply it by 1e5, rounding the result:
    -17998321
    3. Convert the decimal value to binary. Note that a negative value must be calculated using its two&#39;s complement by inverting the binary value and adding one to the result:
    00000001 00010010 10100001 11110001
    11111110 11101101 01011110 00001110
    11111110 11101101 01011110 00001111
    4. Left-shift the binary value one bit:
    11111101 11011010 10111100 00011110
    5. If the original decimal value is negative, invert this encoding:
    00000010 00100101 01000011 11100001
    6. Break the binary value out into 5-bit chunks (starting from the right hand side):
    00001 00010 01010 10000 11111 00001
    7. Place the 5-bit chunks into reverse order:
    00001 11111 10000 01010 00010 00001
    8. OR each value with 0x20 if another bit chunk follows:
    100001 111111 110000 101010 100010 000001
    9. Convert each value to decimal:
    33 63 48 42 34 1
    10. Add 63 to each value:
    96 126 111 105 97 64
    11. Convert each value to its ASCII equivalent:

<p>nothing about this is obviously wrong although if you read the
instructions I showed (and not the blurbs above and below) carefully
there’s two mistake that I made. First I didn’t encode all 30 bits I
needed, I only got 25 and second I Or’d every bit chunk with 0x20 rather
than all but the last one. In my opinion that bit of the documentation
is worded badly “OR each value with 0x20 if another bit chunk follows”,
compared to “OR all but the last value with 0x20” but that’s not my main
complaint. My main complaint is that they have step by step instructions
which I just showed <strong>in addition</strong> to a critical paragraph
block above it which I skipped due to convention being that if you have
a step by step guide in either documentation or a tutorial that
everything that needs to be done is contained within those steps. I’ve
copied the critical paragraph below with important bit that I messed up
boldened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The encoding process converts a binary value into a series of
character codes for ASCII characters using the familiar base64 encoding
scheme: to ensure proper display of these characters, encoded values are
summed with 63 (the ASCII character ‘?’) before converting them into
ASCII. The algorithm also checks for additional character codes for a
given point by checking the least significant bit of each byte group; if
this bit is set to 1, the point is not yet fully formed and additional
data must follow. Additionally, to conserve space, <strong>points only
include the offset from the previous point</strong> (except of course
for the first point). All points are encoded in Base64 as signed
integers, as latitudes and longitudes are signed values. The encoding
format within a polyline needs to represent two coordinates representing
latitude and longitude to a reasonable precision. Given a maximum
longitude of +/- 180 degrees to a precision of 5 decimal places
(180.00000 to -180.00000), this results in the need for a 32 bit signed
binary integer value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s also boldened on the page itself but regardless I skipped over
it.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why this matters, why was I implementing
polyline and the answer is so I could draw on google maps, and yeah
surprise because of that Broome county buses don’t show up because I did
this wrong. The reason I didn’t fix it was because I wasn’t able to find
out until about 3 hours before submission and didn’t notice for the
first 1-2 of those hours due to a mixture of sleep deprivation and
eating breakfast.</p>
<p>1 - I built a CI system called <a href="">Romance</a> last year which
has a separate repo with the <a href="">frontend</a>, and it needs even
more duct tape and dreams than this years project if you want it to work
properly</p>
<p>2 - <a href="">chrono</a>, <a href="">async-std</a>, and <a
href="">anyhow</a> and I put in and then took out <a
href="">geo-types</a>, <a href="">tokio</a> and <a
href="">sea-orm</a></p>
