<article>
    <p>So in <a href="https://pagwin.xyz/blog/gh_actions/">My last blog</a>,
I briefly mentioned a project I’m working on called <a
href="https://github.com/Pagwin-Fedora/Pogo">Pogo</a> and then said
absolutely nothing about what it actually is or what I was going to do
with it. I did say I wanted to write a blog article on it though and
this is that blog article.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pogo">What is Pogo?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Pagwin-Fedora/Pogo">Pogo</a> is a todo
list I’m working on that I wanted to use as an excuse to learn</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>’s FFI</li>
<li>how to store and retrieve data with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> queries/statements</li>
<li>how to make UI in <a href="https://dart.dev/">Dart</a>/<a
href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a></li>
<li>and how to write <a
href="https://www.goya.com/media/4173/creole-spaghetti.jpg?quality=80">Sphaghetti</a>
in C++</li>
</ol>
<p>I put it this all toegether with copious usage of FFI to connect the
Rust, Go and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> for
the backend and the dart/flutter for the frontend.</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p>But recently I’ve decided that all of that is dumb and unnecessary.
Initially it made sense to use the somewhat unwieldy FFI setup because
the backend was going to take a struct instead of a string and structs
cannot be passed via stdin<sup>[citation needed]</sup>. Once I realized
how hard and unnecessary that was due to FFI things I dropped it. With
that my architecture was just passing around strings and I realized that
my setup is overly complicated for that. So instead of FFI and TCP
spaghetti instead I’m going to have <del>subprocess spaghetti</del> each
component of the application be separate executables of some kind or
another.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-architecture">The New Architecture</h2>
<p>This description is going to suck so I recommend clicking off if you
get bored. For my new architecture there will be 5 components</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The init script</li>
<li>The frontend</li>
<li>the front-to-back middleware</li>
<li>the back-to-front middleware</li>
<li>and The backend.</li>
</ol>
<p>The original repository that held all the code will have it all
removed as the frontend, middleware and backend are developed in
separate repositories which are had as git submodules in the main
repository which will be where an init script and a build script will be
held.</p>
<h3 id="the-init-script">The init script</h3>
<p>The init script is a script that will be running as long as the
application itself holding the frontend, middleware and backend as child
processes.</p>
<h3 id="the-frontend">The frontend</h3>
<p>The frontend will accept user input and print it to stdout in a
manner understood by the middleware and passing state changes given to
it as Pogo messages by stdin to the user.</p>
<h3 id="the-middleware">The middleware</h3>
<p>The front to back middleware will take messages from the frontend and
parse them for the backend to understand and vice versa for back to
front.</p>
<h3 id="the-backend">The backend</h3>
<p>The backend takes messages from stdin and does transforms to the db
and accepts queries of it’s current state printing out the state to
stdout.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I expected this blog to be longer but I realized as I started to
write it that writing about what I had previously done with Pogo was
boring because it was nothing interesting. Well there is some
interesting stuff in how I previously was working on Pogo but most of
that is too tangential for a post on the project itself such as how bad
C/C++ networking is, how good networking is with rust after I stopped
being an idiot, doing battle with Go’s sql library and stuff related to
FFI. I may make a blog post or two on these topics in the future but I
still need to learn more about them to do them justice. Overall the post
was a bit painful to write and I suspect it’s also painful to read. Note
to self write about a project as interesting stuff comes up not to
explain yourself.</p>
