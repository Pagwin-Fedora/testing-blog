    <h1 id="fractions">Fractions</h1>
<p>So recently I’ve been thinking about how fractions could be
represented in binary effieciently. Okay I’ve had it in the back of my
mind for months but <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d6YrTKmjfE">this video</a> gave
me a spark on a solution.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h2>
<p>I don’t remember why I first started considering this but the first
obvious solution I came up with was to do something simple like
this.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode rs"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">struct</span> Fraction<span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    numerator<span class="op">:</span><span class="dt">u32</span><span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    denominator<span class="op">:</span><span class="dt">u32</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which does work, however it’s extremely wasteful with situations like
1/2 = 2/4 = 4/8 = 5/10 = … among others.</p>
<p>This is okay depending on your use case, if you’re okay taking a
memory and computational hit you can just check if any resulting
fraction can be simplified and simplifying. But I don’t like that
because it’s ineffiecient and very inelegant.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-just-use-floating-point-then">Why not just use floating
point then</h2>
<p>Because fractions rule and scientific notation drools, also floating
point is just an approximation bro and thinking about how to solve this
for fractions is fun.</p>
<h2 id="second-solution-attempt">Second solution attempt</h2>
<p>Alright so that first try didn’t work particularly well with how
wasteful it was but I’m sure this time it’ll go better.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode rs"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">struct</span> Rational<span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    integer<span class="op">:</span> <span class="dt">u32</span><span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    fraction<span class="op">:</span> <span class="dt">u32</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>… okay I should probably explain. The denominator of the fraction is
2^32 so now we don’t have to worry about having situations where 2
fractions simplify to the same value because all denominators are the
same meaning that only happens when they’re represented by the same
value, hurrah! Anyways addition and subtraction are both pretty easy and
cheap, just do them piecewise and handle overflows. But multiplication
and division are a problem now because both of them require use to have
some kind of external storage to do and are going to be pretty
computationaly ineffiecient. Well crap.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration-from-the-video">Inspiration from the video</h2>
<p>And that’s basically where I got stuck until I found the video that I
linked above. In the video they describe an algorithm for how you can
get all rational numbers exactly once. Why it works doesn’t matter for
this blog(go watch the video if you care) but I will describe how it
works. First start off with the fractions 0/1 and 1/0 ignoring that the
second is undefined. Now add their numerators and denominators toegether
to get a new number 1/1. Put that new number between them and then
repeat that process with all adjacent numbers for however many steps you
want. What I did with this was stop at a finite number of repetitions(if
you wanna try at home I made a repo that generates all the fractions)
the binary representation would then be whatever indice in the list a
particular fraction was at.</p>
<p>Amusingly this gave the illusion of actually working for a moment.
Namely when I added the indices of x/y and (y-x)/y for a few examples I
got 1. But then I tried adding 1/18 to itself 3 times, and I got
1/16.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-this-work-and-why-does-it-stop-working">Why does this
work and why does it stop working?</h2>
<p>That is the question, well my theory is that there’s a symmetry from
0-1 that makes reflecting all values x/y over the value 1/2 makes them
into (y-x)/y due to the way this sequence is generated. The reason it
doesn’t work for values that don’t add up to 1 is that there’s no
equivalent symmetry which causes problems due to the distribution of
fractions not being uniform over the integers(aka going to and from
integers with this system is non-linear). This problem leaves us without
even a way to salvage a good mechanism of having fractions from 0-1
which would’ve been useful in combination with method 2 if
multiplication and division didn’t cause issue.</p>
<h2 id="oh-wait-solution-2-is-fine-actually">Oh wait solution 2 is fine
actually</h2>
<p>yeah I didn’t think about it hard enough originally, shift both
numbers to the right by half the number of fraction bits before you do
the equivalent integer operation and you’re fine. That said it may make
sense to only allocate a quarter of the number to the fraction(good
enough for most cases) or if I were to actually implement this it’d be
user specified(if people actually started using it then there’d probably
be encoding problems but I’m not even going to make this so not my
problem).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The simplest solution is often terrible but the second simplest is
generally at least okay. This also gives a new appreciation for how
elegant floating point is(dodging the question of how many bits go to
the precision completely). I also have a side quest on making a program
to generate fractions for solution 3 which I intend to start writing
about now.</p>
