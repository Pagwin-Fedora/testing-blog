    <h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>
<p>No this isn’t comprehensive, so no you won’t be able to immediately
go start making something after having read this and no this doesn’t
cover everything you might possibly run into, see <a
href="#The%20Asterisk">#The Asterisk</a>. Also the examples will be in
Pseudocode so this isn’t a generic python/javascript tutorial :P.</p>
<h2 id="the-asterisk">The Asterisk</h2>
<p>If you didn’t notice the asterisk in the title next to every, now you
know there is one. The reason for that asterisk is that this blog only
covers stuff that is common(as built in language features) in procedural
programming. If you don’t know what “procedural” means don’t worry about
it and pretend that this covers every programming language.</p>
<h2 id="the-data">The Data</h2>
<p>Fundamentally programming is about the manipulation of data for
varying purposes. On occasion a programmer will want data to be
displayed which can be accomplished in many ways. For the purposes of
this blog <code>DISPLAY(some_data)</code> indicates that whatever
<code>some_data</code> is should be displayed. Now that data can be
displayed, what data can we have? There are a few different types of
data we can have<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>. For now I’ll only
specify 3. Those 3 are strings, numbers and booleans. First there are
strings, more commonly known as text. In many programming languages,
including our pseudocode, we can create a string in our program by
surrounding some text with quotes <code>"like this"</code>. Our second
type is numbers which hold numbers. We can of course add, subtract,
multiply, divide and raise to a power all of these numbers with the
notation of <code>number1 + number2</code>,
<code>number1 - number2</code>, <code>number1 * number2</code>,
<code>number1 / number2</code> and <code>number1 ^ number2</code>
respectively. Last but not least we have booleans which can hold the
values of <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. Just like how we can
apply different operations onto different number we also have some
operations we can apply to booleans. First we have <code>NOT</code>
which will take a boolean and give back the opposite boolean e.g. true →
false and false → true. Second we have <code>OR</code> which takes 2
booleans and gives back true if either of them are true and false
otherwise. Third we have <code>AND</code> which takes 2 booleans and
gives back true only if both of them are true and false otherwise.
Finally we have <code>XOR</code> which will only give back true if only
1 of it’s inputs is true eg <code>true XOR true</code> → false and
<code>false XOR false</code> → false but <code>true XOR false</code> →
true.</p>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>Variables allow for the storage of data in named<sup><a
href="#2">[2]</a></sup> buckets which is very useful especially when
taking input that can change at runtime. We can put a value into a
variable like so <code>someVar ← "a string"</code> which would set the
variable someVar to the string value of “a string”.</p>
<h2 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h2>
<p>Conditionals(specified with <code>IF</code>) are statements that can
allow us to gate code behind some condition being true. Besides the
obvious of just specifying a boolean value ourself we can also perform
certain tests on other values to get booleans. First we can see if 2
values are the same i.e. the same type and the same value of that type
which we can do with a simple <code>value1 = value2</code> for ease of
syntax we can also see if they are not equal to each other with
<code>value1 ≠ value2</code> furthermore if both values are numbers we
can see if one if greater than or less than the other with
<code>value1 &gt; value2</code> and <code>value1 &lt; value2</code>
respectively. I should probably provide an example snippet of
pseudocode</p>
<pre><code>someNum ← 5
&quot;Sidenote: when I have a statement that can take multiple lines of code&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll surround those lines with curly brackets, also when I need to make&quot;
&quot;a comment which is intended to do nothing to the code like this it&#39;ll be&quot;
&quot;a free floating string(s) which nothing is done with like this&quot;
IF someNum = 5 {
    DISPLAY(&quot;someNum is indeed 5&quot;)
}
ELSE {
    DISPLAY(&quot;I have no idea how this happened&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="procedures">Procedures</h2>
<p>Procedures are blocks of code which we can run when we want without
having to copy and paste, furthermore we can change the values stored in
variables in the procedure that the procedure lets us commonly referred
to as arguments, an example of a procedure(in most procedural languages)
is one which lets the programmer display some text which in our case is
called <code>DISPLAY</code> the exact implementation of which is mostly
unimportant for us to declare our own procedure we’ll just put the word
<code>PROC</code> before the name of our procedure and the arguments
that our procedure takes separated by commas in parentheseses after the
procedure’s name for ane example of one of our user defined procedures
I’ll just write a procedure that prints out “Hello!” and then whatever
was provided as an argument to it</p>
<pre><code>PROC helloProcedure (name) {
    DISPLAY(&quot;Hello!&quot;)
    DISPLAY(name)
}
&quot;the code above hasn&#39;t been run yet we need to call the procedure in order to run it like below&quot;
helloProcedure(&quot;World&quot;)</code></pre>
<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
<p>lists are a methodology of storing multiple data values within a
single variable<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>. When you want to store
or retrieve a value from a list you need to specify at what position in
the list you want to retrieve the value from via a number with the
indexing of that list commonly starting from 0 with certain very special
languages which choose to start or allow the programmer to start lists
from indices other than 0. When declaring a list in our pseudocode I’ll
use square brackets surrounded comma separated values of the list, the
size of the list will not be set in stone for convenience but it should
be noted that in most programming languages you need to be explicit when
making a list larger. An example of creating and using a list is shown
below</p>
<pre><code>someList &lt;- [&quot;First item&quot;, &quot;Second item&quot;, &quot;meh item&quot;]
someList[2] &lt;- &quot;Third item&quot;
&quot;First item should be displayed when the line of code below is run&quot;
DISPLAY(someList[0])</code></pre>
<h2 id="loops">Loops</h2>
<p>loops are kinda self explanatory as they loop running code
repeatedly. Commonly there are 2 types of loop in programming languages
and when there are more they can be easily described in relation to
these 2. These 2 types of loop are called a <code>WHILE</code> loop and
a <code>FOREACH</code><sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> loop. A
<code>WHILE</code> loop will repeatedly run whatever code is inside of
them as long as a condition is met, a foreach loop will go through each
item in a collection of items such as a list and run some code using
that item. Both loops make working with lists much easier because we
don’t need to write out the code for every single list entry and if the
list we may be dealing with will have a size that cannot be known at the
time of writing the program might, with the combination of some
methodology of retrieving the length of the list, be the only option.
the syntax for <code>FOREACH</code> loops will borrow from the syntax
for assignment with the variable which will go through each value in our
list being assigned to and the loop values are being pulled from being
used as the value to assign from</p>
<pre><code>i &lt;- 0
&quot;initializing an empty list which will be filled with the while loop below&quot;
dataSet = []
WHILE i &lt; 50 {
    dataSet[i] &lt;- i + 1
}
&quot;both loops below will display all the values in the list in the var dataSet&quot;
i &lt;- 0
WHILE i &lt; 50 {
    DISPLAY(dataSet[i])
    &quot;August 2024 pagwin here, just realized I&quot;
    &quot;also forgot this for the other while loop&quot;
    &quot;if you saw this article prior to March 2024&quot;
    &quot;I forgot to include the line below sorry about that.&quot;
    i &lt;- i + 1
}
FOREACH n &lt;- dataSet {
    DISPLAY(n)
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That should cover the basic syntax features someone trying to learn a
procedural programming langauge should be trying to learn. Some
programming languages have macros, terenary statements and extensive
standard libraries which will have a bunch of useful utilities those are
best learned once these basic syntax features are understood and
different langauges tend to differ regarding what and whether these
features are include</p>
<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
<p><a href="./#1" name="1">1</a> - I see you in the back there person
who wants to be technically correct(if I wasn’t writing this it’d be me)
with your statements about how in C a lot of what differentiates types
is just dereferencing the integer pointers down to their values and
pretending chars aren’t integers but I don’t care so shut up.</p>
<p><a href="./#2" name="2">2</a> - most programming languages have
certain specifications on what you can name your variables and there’s
also reccomended ways you should name your variables and both of these
can vary per language so you should probably read their documentation
for specifics but for my purposes I’m gonna stick to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">camelCase</a> using only
english letters as I’m unaware of any non-esoteric programing languages
which disallow such naming</p>
<p><a href="./#3" name="3">3</a> - some programming languages will call
foreach loops just for loops but most languages call them foreach
loops</p>
<p><a href="./#4" name="4">4</a> - Hello pagwin from March 2024 here, I
was reading this back and realized that it’s more complicated than this
and I forgot to mention that at the time. As you can see from the code
below the 4 annotation oftentimes you can assign to elements of a list
individually without needing to remake the entire list around it and
assign the whole list to the variable again. A more accurate description
is a list is a way to hold multiple buckets you can store values in
within a single variable. Going beyond that involves talking about
references and that’s beyond this article’s scope.</p>
