<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>
<p>Before we get to how I actually made this site let’s discussed how I
failed to make this site(repeatedly). I was inspired to make a simple
website/blog from <a href="https://k1ss.org/blog/20191004a">this blog
post</a>, I rapidly regretted having that as my main inspiration. I
tried setting up scripts for generating pages using the output from
pandoc, making the pages look nice and what not as well as make a script
for generating an rss feed but rapidly realized that all of this was
going to be a pain and gave up. Rinse and repeat a couple of times over
several months to a year or so.</p>
<h2 id="actually-making-this-website">Actually making this website</h2>
<p>One day(2 days before this post was written actually) I was browsing
reddit when I came across <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/j0wcfj/i_hand_you_a_computer_with_a_minimalistic_install/g6vxxxj/">this
comment</a> and realized that I’m an idiot because static site
generators exist and what I had previously been doing was basically
writing my own, I may still write my own but more so as a project on
it’s own than as something that’s contributing to something else. After
that work went relatively smoothly with me spending the first day
learning what the fuck hugo(no I didn’t do my research into static site
generators don’t judge me okay) is then on the second day I actually
started to get into writing all the stuff for the site. For my theme as
you may already know if you’ve looked at the footer for this website I’m
using liquorice as my theme. I chose it for being simple, very nice for
reading text(what I expect will be the main thing that’s done on this
website) and because I just liked the overall feel. There were some
aspects that I felt the need to improve though such as the homepage
being a bit more than just a list of every page on the site, something
about lists(I don’t remember what), making the subsections of these
blogs and other pages in the future jump points in case I write
something that would actually benefit from those jump points and not
just a short one page piece and finally making the links actually look
visually distinct from the text beyond simply being bold. There are
probably other changes I’m forgetting and in the future I expect I’ll
tweak this further but that’s all for now. Some of those tweaks will be
me making the website smaller and more compressed following the original
spirit of that kiss blog and I can already see some points where I can
shave some size off but that’s a story for another time.</p>
<h2 id="making-the-jump-points">Making the jump points</h2>
<p>most of those points are pretty easy if you read hugo’s documentation
and are willing to try random things but the jump points are a slight
challenge and something worth writing about in more detail. First things
first ignoring all this being generated from markdown causing some
oddities how do we make a jump point on a webpage? Well with anchor tags
of course!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">a</span><span class="ot"> name</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;some_name_or_something_idk&quot;</span><span class="ot"> href</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;./#some_name_or_something_idk&quot;</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span>some content doesn&#39;t matter<span class="dt">&lt;/</span><span class="kw">a</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>this is nice now if somebody goes to
example.com/#some_name_or_something_idk their browser will jump them
straight down to wherever that anchor tag is. But it doesn’t jump to the
anchorblock when we click on it it simply sets our url and if we reload
it jumps to it. <em>Editor’s note: as I write this I’m unsure if I’m an
idiot who didn’t need to do the work with this javascript I’m about to
talk about so it may well be possible that it’s unnecessary and the
above code already does that</em>. So in order to fix that we’ll be
adding an event to our anchor element like this.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">a</span><span class="ot"> name</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;name&quot;</span><span class="ot"> href</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;./#name&quot;</span><span class="ot"> id</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;name&quot;</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span>some text<span class="dt">&lt;/</span><span class="kw">a</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></span>

<p>Technically the event could be added by adding an onclick parameter
to the anchor element in the dom but we we start dealing with another
problem which I’ll get to after explaining this it’ll be way cleaner to
just use <code>addEventListener</code> anyway the code is relatively
self explanatory but I’ll explain it anyways. Our element has an id that
we attached to it by adding the parameter <code>id="name"</code> we can
get our element in our code by asking the browser to give our element to
us using the id as a reference to find the element with the method
<code>document.getElementById</code>. We could totally just use
<code>document.getElementsByName</code> and take the first element from
that but I personally chose to add and use the id. With
<code>addEventListener</code> we can attach a function that’ll be called
when an event fires in this case the click event for when the user
clicks on the anchor element. The function in question take the event
object given to it and takes out the dom element that was actually
clicked on with the target property. We then scroll to that dom element
with scrollIntoView. Now all we need to do is have it so that when we
write out our header elements we just surround them with anchor elements
and… wait.</p>
<h2 id="we-didnt-write-those-header-elements-though">We didn’t write
those header elements though</h2>
<p>Oh yeah we didn’t write the header elements in the first place
they’re written in from whatever markdown generator that hugo uses. Well
how do we handle this? There may be some way of changing how hugo
generates html from the markdown but that sounds hard let’s just write
some javascript.</p>

<p>Ok so you already understand that last bit with the event listener
and what not so allow me to explain the rest.
<code>document.getElementsByTagName</code> is the same as
<code>document.getElementById</code> except it gets more than one
element and does it by their tag name. The for loop iterates through all
the elements we just got and through each iteration we can refer to the
element we’re on by the variable <code>elem</code>. The parameter of
<code>outerHTML</code> isn’t used very often <code>innerHTML</code> and
<code>innerText</code> are used more often because most people only want
to control the text inside of a dom element but want to leave the outer
tags untouched but in this case that’s useful because we actually want
to add anchor tags around our header tags which is what we do. Hooray
the problem with the markdown generation not allowing fine enough
control was solved. Now about adding that script in to do that work.</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-script-in">Adding the script in</h2>
<p>You’d think this was simple and it kinda was but keep in mind that
I’ve only been using hugo for less than 3 days at this point. Besides
that I also only wanted this script in the single pages or the pages
that blog/articles/whatever were on and not on list pages which list out
all the pages as the list pages also used h2 elements but I didn’t want
the h2 elements there to be modified by this script. Thankfully this was
easy because I had shortly before hand wanted to do something similar
with a stylesheet but man adding in that stylesheet had some nuisances.
The first thing I found of use for this purpose was <a
href="https://gohugo.io/functions/cond/">cond</a> but I still needed to
figure out how to test for whether the page was a list or not so I
started looking through hugo’s page variables and I found 3 candidates
for this <code>.IsNode</code>, <code>.IsPage</code> and
<code>.IsSection</code> with the last one just being the negate. I got
somewhat frustrated when I found none of these useful for what I was
trying to do. Eventually I stumbled upon <code>.Kind</code> and bumbled
about a bit trying to figure out how to test for a <code>.Kind</code> of
page until I found <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/eq/">eq</a>. So
great I now can test for whether a page is a page I want the stylesheet
applied to so</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>{{ cond (eq .Page.Kind &quot;page&quot;) &quot;<span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">link</span><span class="ot"> rel</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&#39;stylesheet&#39;</span><span class="ot"> href</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&#39;{{.Site.BaseURL}}/css/single.css&#39;</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span>&quot; &quot;&quot; }}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>should work right? Nope nope nope for multiple reasons nope. For one
thing trying to put the base url with curly brackets didn’t work because
apparently hugo doesn’t do curly brackets in curly brackets also when I
opened the page in a browser the tag and all the tags beneath it(which
were placed in the head in the partial template btw) are now in the
body??? Also I made it seem like I had solved the cond thing before this
came up but that was happening at this point as well. So first things
first how do we put a variable midway through a tag that we’re
inserting? Well apparently the answer to that is <a
href="https://gohugo.io/functions/printf/">printf</a>(I personally
would’ve named it something like format rather than printf even if it
uses something called printf internally but maybe that’s just me) so now
we have.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>{{ cond (eq .Page.Kind &quot;page&quot;) (printf &quot;<span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">link</span><span class="ot"> rel</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&#39;stylesheet&#39;</span><span class="ot"> href</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&#39;%s/css/single.css&#39;</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span>&quot; .Site.BaseURL) &quot;&quot; }}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>which is closer but it still jumps into the body for some reason.
That reason as it turns out is because Hugo <del>being somewhat annoying
because it decides not to warn you for failing to be explicit about
whether you want a tag as a tag</del> being very cool and safe escaping
all the tags to prevent cross site scripting/injection or whatever else
problems in code that you’re explicitly writing out in a folder for
templates. Ugh anyways after running the output of the printf through <a
href="https://gohugo.io/functions/safehtml/">SafeHTML</a> we get this
final iteration that works how I want it to of.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>{{ cond (eq .Page.Kind &quot;page&quot;) ( safeHTML (printf &quot;<span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">link</span><span class="ot"> rel</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&#39;stylesheet&#39;</span><span class="ot"> href</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&#39;%s/css/single.css&#39;</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span>&quot; .Site.BaseURL)) &quot;&quot; }}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Nothing about this changes for the script that we want on our blog
pages only other than that we replace link with a script tag.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was fun and I’m glad I found out about the existance of <a
href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a>. I’ll probably update this site in
the future and this blog will probably get outdated but unless I decide
the site looks almost completely different run into a very annoying or
interesting problem or completely remake the site for osme reason or
another I probably won’t update this blog or release any other blogs
with updates on changes I make to this site(and knowing me even when
those things come up I probably won’t write about them) one of the
things I want to change is the links to different
platforms/feeds/whatever but based on already made efforts I think I’ll
save that for another time.</p>
